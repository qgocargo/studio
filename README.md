# Q'go Cargo - Static Proof of Delivery PWA

This is a pure static Progressive Web App for managing Proof of Deliveries, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It uses Firebase on the client-side for all data storage and authentication.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Add Your Firebase Configuration

Before you can run the app, you need to add your Firebase project configuration.

Open the `index.html` file and find the following placeholder script tag near the top of the `<body>`:

```html
<!-- 
  TODO: PASTE YOUR FIREBASE CONFIG HERE 
  This object is found in your Firebase project settings.
-->
<script>
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
  };
</script>
```

Replace the placeholder values with the actual configuration object from your Firebase project. You will need to do the same for the `track.html` file.

### 2. Run Locally

You cannot open `index.html` directly in the browser due to CORS security policies with JavaScript modules. You need to serve the files using a local web server.

1.  **Install a local server (if you don't have one):**
    A popular and easy choice is `http-server` via npm.
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

2.  **Start the server:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    http-server
    ```

3.  **Open the app:**
    Open your browser and go to the local address provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:8080`).

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    Create a new repository on GitHub and push the project files to it.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    - In your repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
    - Under "Build and deployment", select the source as **Deploy from a branch**.
    - Choose the branch you pushed your code to (e.g., `main`) and the folder as `/(root)`.
    - Click **Save**.

GitHub will deploy your site and provide you with the public URL. It may take a few minutes for the site to become live.
